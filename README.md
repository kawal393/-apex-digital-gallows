# THE GALLOWS ARE READY

**TRIO COMPLETE: Police + Lawyer + Judge**

---

## THE TRIO - THREE MODES, ABSOLUTE CONTROL

### SHIELD MODE (Lawyer)
- **Role**: Defender of the $380B Giants
- **Function**: Private compliance verification
- **Pitch**: "Pay me to protect you from EU fines"
- **Audit Log**: Private Merkle Tree (client-owned)
- **Alerting**: Internal safety flags only
- **Verification**: MPC keeps weights 100% secret
- **Certification**: Private compliance report

### SWORD MODE (Police)
- **Role**: Enforcer for the EU Commission
- **Function**: Expose violations to regulators
- **Pitch**: "I'll give the EU the truth about the giants"
- **Audit Log**: Public/Regulator-visible
- **Alerting**: Whistleblower Hook → EU AI Office
- **Verification**: ZK Proofs (verifiable truth)
- **Certification**: Public Certificate of Trust

### JUDGE MODE (The Authority)
- **Role**: Set the Standards
- **Function**: Issue binding legal rulings
- **Pitch**: "I am the law"
- **Audit Log**: Canonical (legal standard)
- **Alerting**: Court rulings → Legal precedent
- **Verification**: Binding interpretation
- **Certification**: Legal precedent

## The Strategy: Be All Three

### Phase 1 (Lawyer): Sell to companies as "Privacy Tool"
- Get your code inside their systems
- They pay you to be their "Regulatory Bodyguard"

### Phase 2 (Police): Because your code is the Standard
- EU calls YOU to verify when whistleblower reports come in
- You become the only person who can verify the truth

### Phase 3 (Judge): Set the standards
- Your rulings become legal precedent
- Courts cite your interpretations
- You ARE the law

## The Technology

### 1. Merkle Ledger (Article 12)
- RFC 6962 compliant immutable audit trail
- Tamper-proof event logging
- Generates ATA-1 compliant anchors
- Cryptographic proofs of compliance

### 2. MPC Verification Network
- 3-of-5 threshold signature scheme
- Privacy-preserving computation
- No single point of trust

### 3. ZK Proof Engine (Article 13)
- Verify model behavior without disclosure
- Prove compliance without exposing IP
- Generates OMPC-1 attestations

### 4. Sovereign Switch
- Toggle between SHIELD / SWORD / JUDGE
- Dead Man's Switch for automatic alerts
- No-touch architecture (never hold the keys)
